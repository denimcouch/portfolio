# Portfolio Website

This is my custom-made portfolio website.
The hamburger UI layout was created with HTML/CSS. No JavaScript was used for it.
You can view this site simply by opening the `index.html` file.  
Alternatively, if you are using VS Code you can use Live Server.  
If you don't have Live Server you can download the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
