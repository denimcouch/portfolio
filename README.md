# Portfolio Website

This is my custom-made portfolio website.
The hamburger UI layout was created with HTML/CSS. No JavaScript was used for it.

# Resources
[Modern HTML & CSS](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013eAAEcaeFdUQn0A/) from Brad Traversy - This course helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills immensely.  
[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Font Awesome has so many free icons for easy use.    
[Jquery cdn link](https://code.jquery.com/) - Jquery helped me achieve the smooth scroll effect.
